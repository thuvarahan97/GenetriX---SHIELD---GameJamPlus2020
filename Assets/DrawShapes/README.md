# Draw 2D Physics Shapes in Unity3D

This tutorial project provides an example of how to draw shapes with the cursor in Unity similar to [IncrediBots](http://incredibots.com/if/game.php) or [Phun (now Algodoo)](http://www.algodoo.com/).

The core logic of this project uses vertices specified from the cursor's coordinates to dynamically generate and configure a mesh, outline, and 2D collider.

## Running the Project

To run the project, open `_Scenes/Main.unity` and click on the play button.

In the main scene there will be three buttons: square, circle, and triangle. Click on one of the buttons and then click 2-3 points in the game view to draw and release a physics shape. The shape will react to gravity and interact with other objects in the scene.
